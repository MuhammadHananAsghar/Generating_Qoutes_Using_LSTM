              "'I went to the woods because I wished to live deliberately  to front only the essential facts of life  and see if I could not learn what it had to teach  and not  when I came to die  discover that I had not lived If a man does not keep pace with his companions  perhaps it is because he hears a different drummer Let him step to the music which he hears  however measured or far away What lies behind us and what lies ahead of us are tiny matters compared to what lives within us Rather than love  than money  than fame  give me truth Its not what you look at that matters  its what you see Success usually comes to those who are too busy to be looking for it Many men go fishing all of their lives without knowing that it is not fish they are after If one advances confidently in the direction of his dreams  and endeavors to live the life which he has imagined  he will meet with a success unexpected in common hours An early morning walk is a blessing for the whole day This world is but a canvas to our imagination The price of anything is the amount of life you exchange for it There are a thousand hacking at the branches of evil to one who is striking at the root Things do not change  we change Never look back unless you are planning to go that way Could a greater miracle take place than for us to look through each others eyes for an instant Heaven is under our feet as well as over our heads Not until we are lost do we begin to understand ourselves I know of no more encouraging fact than the unquestionable ability of man to elevate his life by conscious endeavor Disobedience is the true foundation of liberty The obedient must be slaves If you have built castles in the air  your work need not be lost  that is where they should be Now put the foundations under them Be not simply good   be good for something I would rather sit on a pumpkin and have it all to myself  than be crowded on a velvet cushion Our truest life is when we are in dreams awake Our life is frittered away by detail simplify  simplify There is no remedy for love but to love more I say  beware of all enterprises that require new clothes  and not rather a new wearer of clothes Make the most of your regrets  never smother your sorrow  but tend and cherish it till it comes to have a separate and integral interest To regret deeply is to live afresh Goodness is the only investment that never fails Nature will bear the closest inspection She invites us to lay our eye level with her smallest leaf  and take an insect view of its plain It is not enough to be busy So are the ants The question is  What are we busy about Wealth is the ability to fully experience life If the machine of government is of such a nature that it requires you to be the agent of injustice to another  then  I say  break the law As if you could kill time without injuring eternity Not only must we be good  but we must also be good for something Any fool can make a rule  and any fool will mind it Aim above morality Be not simply good  be good for something Pursue some path  however narrow and crooked  in which you can walk with love and reverence The language of friendship is not words but meanings A man is rich in proportion to the number of things he can afford to let alone If I knew for a certainty that a man was coming to my house with the conscious design of doing me good  I should run for my life The light which puts out our eyes is darkness to us Only that day dawns to which we are awake There is more day to dawn The sun is but a morning star It takes two to speak the truth  one to speak  and another to hear The most I can do for my friend is simply be his friend Live your beliefs and you can turn the world around I am grateful for what I am and have My thanksgiving is perpetual The mass of men lead lives of quiet desperation What is called resignation is confirmed desperation Live the life youve dreamed Friends they cherish one anothers hopes They are kind to one anothers dreams None are so old as those who have outlived enthusiasm Thank God men cannot fly  and lay waste the sky as well as the earth There is no value in life except what you choose to place upon it and no happiness in any place except what you bring to it yourself Nothing makes the earth seem so spacious as to have friends at a distance  they make the latitudes and longitudes You must live in the present  launch yourself on every wave  find your eternity in each moment The bluebird carries the sky on his back Men have become the tools of their tools It is better to have your head in the clouds  and know where you are than to breathe the clearer atmosphere below them  and think that you are in paradise Do not hire a man who does your work for money  but him who does it for love of it Nature is full of genius  full of the divinity  so that not a snowflake escapes its fashioning hand What is the use of a house if you havent got a tolerable planet to put it on I have always been regretting that I was not as wise as the day I was born The best and most beautiful things in the world cannot be seen or even touched   they must be felt with the heart We can do anything we want to if we stick to it long enough Optimism is the faith that leads to achievement Nothing can be done without hope and confidence Keep your face to the sunshine and you cannot see a shadow Alone we can do so little  together we can do so much Faith is the strength by which a shattered world shall emerge into the light Character cannot be developed in ease and quiet Only through experience of trial and suffering can the soul be strengthened  ambition inspired  and success achieved What we have once enjoyed we can never lose All that we love deeply becomes a part of us Walking with a friend in the dark is better than walking alone in the light The only thing worse than being blind is having sight but no vision Although the world is full of suffering  it is also full of the overcoming of it Everything has its wonders  even darkness and silence  and I learn  whatever state I may be in  therein to be content Security is mostly a superstition It does not exist in nature  nor do the children of men as a whole experience it Avoiding danger is no safer in the long run than outright exposure Life is either a daring adventure  or nothing Never bend your head Always hold it high Look the world straight in the eye Love is like a beautiful flower which I may not touch  but whose fragrance makes the garden a place of delight just the same We could never learn to be brave and patient  if there were only joy in the world The world is moved along  not only by the mighty shoves of its heroes  but also by the aggregate of tiny pushes of each honest worker The highest result of education is tolerance I long to accomplish a great and noble task  but it is my chief duty to accomplish small tasks as if they were great and noble True happiness is not attained through self gratification  but through fidelity to a worthy purpose Life is either a great adventure or nothing One can never consent to creep when one feels an impulse to soar So long as the memory of certain beloved friends lives in my heart  I shall say that life is good Avoiding danger is no safer in the long run than outright exposure The fearful are caught as often as the bold Your success and happiness lies in you Resolve to keep happy  and your joy and you shall form an invincible host against difficulties When we do the best that we can  we never know what miracle is wrought in our life  or in the life of another Knowledge is love and light and vision Death is no more than passing from one room into another But theres a difference for me  you know Because in that other room I shall be able to see Until the great mass of the people shall be filled with the sense of responsibility for each others welfare  social justice can never be attained To me a lush carpet of pine needles or spongy grass is more welcome than the most luxurious Persian rug No pessimist ever discovered the secret of the stars  or sailed to an uncharted land  or opened a new doorway for the human spirit While they were saying among themselves it cannot be done  it was done The marvelous richness of human experience would lose something of rewarding joy if there were no limitations to overcome The hilltop hour would not be half so wonderful if there were no dark valleys to traverse It is hard to interest those who have everything in those who have nothing Many persons have a wrong idea of what constitutes true happiness It is not attained through self gratification but through fidelity to a worthy purpose The most pathetic person in the world is someone who has sight  but has no vision What I am looking for is not out there  it is in me Once I knew only darkness and stillness my life was without past or future but a little word from the fingers of another fell into my hand that clutched at emptiness  and my heart leaped to the rapture of living I seldom think about my limitations  and they never make me sad Perhaps there is just a touch of yearning at times  but it is vague  like a breeze among flowers Self pity is our worst enemy and if we yield to it  we can never do anything wise in this world Science may have found a cure for most evils  but it has found no remedy for the worst of them all   the apathy of human beings I do not want the peace which passeth understanding  I want the understanding which bringeth peace Life is an exciting business  and most exciting when it is lived for others It is a terrible thing to see and have no vision Of all the senses  sight must be the most delightful Toleration is the greatest gift of the mind  it requires the same effort of the brain that it takes to balance oneself on a bicycle All the world is full of suffering It is also full of overcoming Its wonderful to climb the liquid mountains of the sky Behind me and before me is God and I have no fears It is wonderful how much time good people spend fighting the devil If they would only expend the same amount of energy loving their fellow men  the devil would die in his own tracks of ennui People do not like to think If one thinks  one must reach conclusions Conclusions are not always pleasant I can see  and that is why I can be happy  in what you call the dark  but which to me is golden I can see a God made world  not a manmade world Smell is a potent wizard that transports you across thousands of miles and all the years you have lived As the eagle was killed by the arrow winged with his own feather  so the hand of the world is wounded by its own skill Literature is my Utopia Here I am not disenfranchised No barrier of the senses shuts me out from the sweet  gracious discourses of my book friends They talk to me without embarrassment or awkwardness The heresy of one age becomes the orthodoxy of the next It is for us to pray not for tasks equal to our powers  but for powers equal to our tasks  to go forward with a great desire forever beating at the door of our hearts as we travel toward our distant goal What a blind person needs is not a teacher but another self There is no king who has not had a slave among his ancestors  and no slave who has not had a king among his College isnt the place to go for ideas As selfishness and complaint pervert the mind  so love with its joy clears and sharpens the vision It is easier to build strong children than to repair broken men Where justice is denied  where poverty is enforced  where ignorance prevails  and where any one class is made to feel that society is an organized conspiracy to oppress  rob and degrade them  neither persons nor property will be safe It is not light that we need  but fire  it is not the gentle shower  but thunder We need the storm  the whirlwind  and the earthquake I prayed for twenty years but received no answer until I prayed with my legs Power concedes nothing without a demand It never did and it never will Find out just what any people will quietly submit to and you have the exact measure of the injustice and wrong which will be imposed on them The limits of tyrants are prescribed by the endurance of those whom they oppress The life of the nation is secure only while the nation is honest  truthful  and virtuous No man can put a chain about the ankle of his fellow man without at last finding the other end fastened about his own neck I am a Republican  a black  dyed in the wool Republican  and I never intend to belong to any other party than the party of freedom and progress If there is no struggle  there is no progress To suppress free speech is a double wrong It violates the rights of the hearer as well as those of the speaker The thing worse than rebellion is the thing that causes rebellion One and God make a majority The soul that is within me no man can degrade I prefer to be true to myself  even at the hazard of incurring the ridicule of others  rather than to be false  and to incur my own abhorrence A mans character always takes its hue  more or less  from the form and color of things about him America is false to the past  false to the present  and solemnly binds herself to be false to the future People might not get all they work for in this world  but they must certainly work for all they get Those who profess to favor freedom  and yet depreciate agitation  are men who want crops without plowing up the ground We have to do with the past only as we can make it useful to the present and the future The white mans happiness cannot be purchased by the black mans misery I didnt know I was a slave until I found out I couldnt do the things I wanted A battle lost or won is easily described  understood  and appreciated  but the moral growth of a great nation requires reflection  as well as observation  to appreciate it When men sow the wind it is rational to expect that they will reap the whirlwind Mans greatness consists in his ability to do and the proper application of his powers to things needed to be done At a time like this  scorching irony  not convincing argument  is needed A gentleman will not insult me  and no man not a gentleman can insult me A little learning  indeed  may be a dangerous thing  but the want of learning is a calamity to any people Everybody has asked the question  and they learned to ask it early of the abolitionists  What shall we do with the Negro I have had but one answer from the beginning Do nothing with us  Your doing with us has already played the mischief with us What to the Slave is the 4th of July Those who profess to favor freedom  and yet deprecate agitation  are men who want crops without plowing up the ground I recognize the Republican party as the sheet anchor of the colored mans political hopes and the ark of his safety There is not a man beneath the canopy of Heaven who does not know that slavery is wrong for him That which is inhuman cannot be divine I could  as a free man  look across the bay toward the Eastern Shore where I was born a slave Slaves are generally expected to sing as well as to work Experience demonstrates that there may be a wages of slavery only a little less galling and crushing in its effects than chattel slavery  and that this slavery of wages must go down with the other Fugitive slaves were rare then  and as a fugitive slave lecturer  I had the advantage of being the first one out Great achievement is usually born of great sacrifice  and is never the result of selfishness Think twice before you speak  because your words and influence will plant the seed of either success or failure in the mind of another Every adversity  every failure  every heartache carries with it the seed of an equal or greater benefit Strength and growth come only through continuous effort and struggle If you cannot do great things  do small things in a great way Whatever the mind of man can conceive and believe  it can achieve The man who does more than he is paid for will soon be paid for more than he does The starting point of all achievement is desire It takes half your life before you discover life is a do it yourself project Cherish your visions and your dreams as they are the children of your soul  the blueprints of your ultimate achievements Patience  persistence and perspiration make an unbeatable combination for success Dont wait The time will never be just right A goal is a dream with a deadline If you do not conquer self  you will be conquered by self Opportunity often comes disguised in the form of misfortune  or temporary defeat Victory is always possible for the person who refuses to stop fighting It is literally true that you can succeed best and quickest by helping others to succeed Procrastination is the bad habit of putting off until the day after tomorrow what should have been done the day before yesterday Education comes from within  you get it by struggle and effort and thought Effort only fully releases its reward after a person refuses to quit Your big opportunity may be right where you are now The ladder of success is never crowded at the top Desire is the starting point of all achievement  not a hope  not a wish  but a keen pulsating desire which transcends everything There is one quality which one must possess to win  and that is definiteness of purpose  the knowledge of what one wants  and a burning desire to possess it Action is the real measure of intelligence What the mind of man can conceive and believe  it can achieve There is no such thing as Something for nothing More gold has been mined from the thoughts of men than has been taken from the earth Fears are nothing more than a state of mind Most great people have attained their greatest success just one step beyond their greatest failure Man  alone  has the power to transform his thoughts into physical reality  man  alone  can dream and make his dreams come true First comes thought  then organization of that thought  into ideas and plans  then transformation of those plans into reality The beginning  as you will observe  is in your imagination When defeat comes  accept it as a signal that your plans are not sound  rebuild those plans  and set sail once more toward your coveted goal Persistence is to the character of man as carbon is to steel The best way to sell yourself to others is first to sell the others to yourself Edison failed 10 000 times before he made the electric light Do not be discouraged if you fail a few times No man can succeed in a line of endeavor which he does not like Happiness is found in doing  not merely possessing Create a definite plan for carrying out your desire and begin at once  whether you ready or not  to put this plan into action No man is ever whipped until he quits in his own mind When your desires are strong enough you will appear to possess superhuman powers to achieve Wise men  when in doubt whether to speak or to keep quiet  give themselves the benefit of the doubt  and remain silent The majority of men meet with failure because of their lack of persistence in creating new plans to take the place of those which fail All achievements  all earned riches  have their beginning in an idea There are no limitations to the mind except those we acknowledge Big pay and little responsibility are circumstances seldom found together Before success comes in any mans life  hes sure to meet with much temporary defeat and  perhaps some failures When defeat overtakes a man  the easiest and the most logical thing to do is to quit Thats exactly what the majority of men do Nature cannot be tricked or cheated She will give up to you the object of your struggles only after you have paid her price Any idea  plan  or purpose may be placed in the mind through repetition of thought Money without brains is always dangerous You might well remember that nothing can bring you success but yourself The world has the habit of making room for the man whose actions show that he knows where he is going Just as our eyes need light in order to see  our minds need ideas in order to conceive Every person who wins in any undertaking must be willing to cut all sources of retreat Only by doing so can one be sure of maintaining that state of mind known as a burning desire to win   essential to success All the breaks you need in life wait within your imagination  Imagination is the workshop of your mind  capable of turning mind energy into accomplishment and wealth If you must speak ill of another  do not speak it  write it in the sand near the waters edge It is always your next move No man ever achieved worth while success who did not  at one time or other  find himself with at least one foot hanging well over the brink of failure Everyone enjoys doing the kind of work for which he is best suited You can start right where you stand and apply the habit of going the extra mile by rendering more service and better service than you are now being paid for Love is our true destiny We do not find the meaning of life by ourselves alone   we find it with another Pride makes us artificial and humility makes us real Art enables us to find ourselves and lose ourselves at the same time Happiness is not a matter of intensity but of balance  order  rhythm and harmony The beginning of love is to let those we love be perfectly themselves  and not to twist them to fit our own image Otherwise we love only the reflection of ourselves we find in them We are not at peace with others because we are not at peace with ourselves  and we are not at peace with ourselves because we are not at peace with God The whole idea of compassion is based on a keen awareness of the interdependence of all these living beings  which are all part of one another  and all involved in one another Peace demands the most heroic labor and the most difficult sacrifice It demands greater heroism than war It demands greater fidelity to the truth and a much more perfect purity of conscience When ambition ends  happiness begins Every moment and every event of every mans life on earth plants something in his soul The biggest human temptation is to settle for too little What can we gain by sailing to the moon if we are not able to cross the abyss that separates us from ourselves This is the most important of all voyages of discovery  and without it  all the rest are not only useless  but disastrous Perhaps I am stronger than I think Love seeks one thing only  the good of the one loved It leaves all the other secondary effects to take care of themselves Love  therefore  is its own reward We do not exist for ourselves alone  and it is only when we are fully convinced of this fact that we begin to love ourselves properly and thus also love others We have what we seek  it is there all the time  and if we give it time  it will make itself known to us If you want to study the social and political history of modern nations  study hell A life is either all spiritual or not spiritual at all No man can serve two masters Your life is shaped by the end you live for You are made in the image of what you desire We must make the choices that enable us to fulfill the deepest capacities of our real selves We are so obsessed with doing that we have no time and no imagination left for being As a result  men are valued not for what they are but for what they do or what they have   for their usefulness We stumble and fall constantly even when we are most enlightened But when we are in true spiritual darkness  we do not even know that we have fallen By reading the scriptures I am so renewed that all nature seems renewed around me and with me The sky seems to be a pure  a cooler blue  the trees a deeper green The whole world is charged with the glory of God and I feel fire and music under my feet Solitude is not something you must hope for in the future Rather  it is a deepening of the present  and unless you look for it in the present you will never find it The tighter you squeeze  the less you have Just remaining quietly in the presence of God  listening to Him  being attentive to Him  requires a lot of courage and know how To consider persons and events and situations only in the light of their effect upon myself is to live on the doorstep of hell Yet it is in this loneliness that the deepest activities begin It is here that you discover act without motion  labor that is profound repose  vision in obscurity  and  beyond all desire  a fulfillment whose limits extend to infinity A daydream is an evasion Be good  keep your feet dry  your eyes open  your heart at peace and your soul in the joy of Christ In the last analysis  the individual person is responsible for living his own life and for finding himself If he persists in shifting his responsibility to somebody else  he fails to find out the meaning of his own existence The very contradictions in my life are in some ways signs of Gods mercy to me October is a fine and dangerous season in America a wonderful time to begin anything at all You go to college  and every course in the catalogue looks wonderful Wheels of fire  cosmic  rich  full bodied honest victories over desperation Death is someone you see very clearly with eyes in the center of your heart  eyes that see not by reacting to light  but by reacting to a kind of a chill from within the marrow of your own life The first step toward finding God  Who is Truth  is to discover the truth about myself  and if I have been in error  this first step to truth is the discovery of my error I cannot make the universe obey me I cannot make other people conform to my own whims and fancies I cannot make even my own body obey me The least of the work of learning is done in the classroom On the last day of January 1915  in the second year of the Great War  down in the shadow of some French mountains on the borders of Spain  I came into this world Attachment to spiritual things is just as much an attachment as inordinate love of anything else Advertising treats all products with the reverence and the seriousness due to sacraments I brought all the instincts of a writer with me into the monastery The best preparation for tomorrow is doing your best today Never forget the three powerful resources you always have available to you  love  prayer  and forgiveness Live so that when your children think of fairness  caring  and integrity  they think of you Our character is what we do when we think no one is looking Love is when the other persons happiness is more important than your own Life doesnt require that we be the best  only that we try our best Remember that the happiest people are not those getting more  but those giving more Sometimes the heart sees what is invisible to the eye Nothing is more expensive than a missed opportunity Opportunity dances with those already on the dance floor Remember that the most valuable antiques are dear old friends Never give up on what you really want to do The person with big dreams is more powerful than the one with all the facts Earn your success based on service to others  not at the expense of others Talent without discipline is like an octopus on roller skates Theres plenty of movement  but you never know if its going to be forward  backwards  or sideways Always kiss your children goodnight  even if theyre already asleep Never deprive someone of hope  it might be all they have You must take action now that will move you towards your goals Develop a sense of urgency in your life Remember that children  marriages  and flower gardens reflect the kind of care they get Dont work for recognition  but do work worthy of recognition If youre doing your best  you wont have any time to worry about failure Think big thoughts but relish small pleasures Success is getting what you want Happiness is liking what you get A true friend encourages us  comforts us  supports us like a big easy chair  offering us a safe refuge from the world You either make dust or eat dust Let the refining and improving of your own life keep you so busy that you have little time to criticize others Choose your lifes mate carefully From this one decision will come 90 percent of all your happiness or misery Find a job you like and you add five days to every week People take different roads seeking fulfillment and happiness Just because theyre not on your road doesnt mean theyve gotten lost Enjoy the satisfaction that comes from doing little things well Hope is not a resting place but a starting point   a cactus  not a cushion Good manners sometimes means simply putting up with other peoples bad manners Always have something beautiful in sight  even if its just a daisy in a jelly glass Protect your enthusiasm from the negativity of others When facing a difficult task  act as though it is impossible to fail If you are going after Moby Dick  take along the tartar sauce Remember that a gesture of friendship  no matter how small  is always appreciated Be smarter than other people  just dont tell them so You cant hire someone to practice for you Remember that lifes big changes rarely give advance warning I never expect to lose Even when Im the underdog  I still prepare a victory speech If someone offers you a breath mint  accept it You can always tell when a mans well informed His views are pretty much like your own Luck marches with those who give their very best See any detour as an opportunity to experience new things Remember that creating a successful marriage is like farming  you have to start over again every morning Watch your finances like a hawk In business or in life  dont follow the wagon tracks too closely Measure your wealth by what youd have left if you lost all your money Marrying an old bachelor is like buying second hand furniture There is a fundamental question we all have to face How are we to live our lives  by what principles and moral values will we be guided and inspired Remember that no relationship is a total waste of time You can always learn something about yourself When you have nothing important or interesting to say  dont let anyone persuade you to say it Compliment three people every day Were constantly striving for success  fame and comfort when all we really need to be happy is someone or some thing to be enthusiastic about Mature love is composed and sustaining  a celebration of commitment  companionship  and trust Its true  once you are a father  theres no turning back Your heart strings as well as your purse strings are never again the same While we may lose heart  we never have to lose hope Living big and joyful and content is almost always the result of our finding satisfaction in lifes ordinary day to day pleasures And God must be fond of them  too  for He made so many of them for us to enjoy Hope is the magic carpet that transports us from the present moment into the realm of infinite possibilities Oh  the difference between nearly right and exactly right Hold puppies  kittens  and babies anytime you get the chance Ants are good citizens  they place group interests first Informations pretty thin stuff unless mixed with experience We must make the best of those ills which cannot be avoided If your parents didnt have any children  theres a good chance that you wont have any The ant is knowing and wise  but he doesnt know enough to take a vacation Age should not have its face lifted  but it should rather teach the world to admire wrinkles as the etchings of experience and the firm line of character There is an art of reading  as well as an art of thinking  and an art of writing Reason is the servant of instinct Too many moralists begin with a dislike of reality We talk of our mastery of nature  which sounds very grand  but the fact is we respectfully adapt ourselves  first  to her ways You cant sweep other people off their feet  if you cant be swept off your own If you dont go to other mens funerals  they wont go to yours A moderate addiction to money may not always be hurtful  but when taken in excess it is nearly always bad for the health Creatures whose mainspring is curiosity enjoy the accumulating of facts far more than the pausing at times to reflect on those facts We must let go of the life we have planned  so as to accept the one that is waiting for us A hero is someone who has given his or her life to something bigger than oneself Find a place inside where theres joy  and the joy will burn out the pain Follow your bliss and the universe will open doors where there were only walls Opportunities to find deeper powers within ourselves come when life seems most challenging The privilege of a lifetime is being who you are The goal of life is to make your heartbeat match the beat of the universe  to match your nature with Nature Life is without meaning You bring the meaning to it The meaning of life is whatever you ascribe it to be Being alive is the meaning Participate joyfully in the sorrows of the world We cannot cure the world of sorrows  but we can choose to live in joy I dont believe people are looking for the meaning of life as much as they are looking for the experience of being alive Your sacred space is where you can find yourself again and again Love is a friendship set to music It is by going down into the abyss that we recover the treasures of life Where you stumble  there lies your treasure Computers are like Old Testament gods  lots of rules and no mercy The big question is whether you are going to be able to say a hearty yes to your adventure Your life is the fruit of your own doing You have no one to blame but yourself God is a metaphor for that which transcends all levels of intellectual thought Its as simple as that Myths are public dreams  dreams are private myths What each must seek in his life never was on land or sea It is something out of his own unique potentiality for experience  something that never has been and never could have been experienced by anyone else When we quit thinking primarily about ourselves and our own self preservation  we undergo a truly heroic transformation of consciousness When people get married because they think its a long time love affair  theyll be divorced very soon  because all love affairs end in disappointment But marriage is a recognition of a spiritual identity Every religion is true one way or another It is true when understood metaphorically But when it gets stuck in its own metaphors  interpreting them as facts  then you are in trouble When you make the sacrifice in marriage  youre sacrificing not to each other but to unity in a relationship I dont have to have faith  I have experience One way or another  we all have to find what best fosters the flowering of our humanity in this contemporary life  and dedicate ourselves to that Were so engaged in doing things to achieve purposes of outer value that we forget the inner value  the rapture that is associated with being alive  is what it is all about I think the person who takes a job in order to live   that is to say  for the money   has turned himself into a slave Is the system going to flatten you out and deny you your humanity  or are you going to be able to make use of the system to the attainment of human purposes If you dont design your own life plan  chances are youll fall into someone elses plan And guess what they have planned for you Not much It always seems impossible until its done Start where you are Use what you have Do what you can Only I can change my life No one can do it for me Failure will never overtake me if my determination to succeed is strong enough Knowing is not enough  we must apply Willing is not enough  we must do Life is 10  what happens to you and 90  how you react to it When something is important enough  you do it even if the odds are not in your favor I can  therefore I am Leap  and the net will appear Problems are not stop signs  they are guidelines There is only one corner of the universe you can be certain of improving  and thats your own self If you can dream it  you can do it I learned that we can do anything  but we cant do everything at least not at the same time So think of your priorities not in terms of what activities you do  but when you do them Timing is everything If you fell down yesterday  stand up today In order to succeed  we must first believe that we can With the new day comes new strength and new thoughts Set your goals high  and dont stop till you get there Perseverance is not a long race  it is many short races one after the other Good  better  best Never let it rest Til your good is better and your better is best If you want to succeed you should strike out on new paths  rather than travel the worn paths of accepted success Dont watch the clock  do what it does Keep going Aim for the moon If you miss  you may hit a star Ever tried Ever failed No matter Try Again Fail again Fail better The will to succeed is important  but whats more important is the will to prepare Change your life today Dont gamble on the future  act now  without delay Be kind whenever possible It is always possible A good plan violently executed now is better than a perfect plan executed next week I dont believe you have to be better than everybody else I believe you have to be better than you ever thought you could be When you reach the end of your rope  tie a knot in it and hang on Even if you fall on your face  youre still moving forward Quality is not an act  it is a habit Every exit is an entry somewhere else No bird soars too high if he soars with his own wings Either I will find a way  or I will make one I am not afraid I was born to do this You just cant beat the person who never gives up The first step toward success is taken when you refuse to be a captive of the environment in which you first find yourself You can never quit Winners never quit  and quitters never win Decide what you want  decide what you are willing to exchange for it Establish your priorities and go to work Motivation is the art of getting people to do what you want them to do because they want to do it I really believe that everyone has a talent  ability  or skill that he can mine to support himself and to succeed in life You simply have to put one foot in front of the other and keep going Put blinders on and plow right ahead Where there is a will  there is a way If there is a chance in a million that you can do something  anything  to keep what you want from ending  do it Pry the door open or  if need be  wedge your foot in that door and keep it open Expect problems and eat them for breakfast Opportunity does not knock  it presents itself when you beat down the door Infuse your life with action Dont wait for it to happen Make it happen Make your own future Make your own hope Make your own love And whatever your beliefs  honor your creator  not by passively waiting for grace to come down from upon high  but by doing what you can to make grace happen yourself  right now  right down here on Earth Perseverance is failing 19 times and succeeding the 20th I am not a has been I am a will be Never retreat Never explain Get it done and let them howl The ultimate aim of the ego is not to see something  but to be something I attribute my success to this   I never gave or took any excuse You will never win if you never begin The secret of getting ahead is getting started Well done is better than well said If youre going through hell  keep going Look up at the stars and not down at your feet Try to make sense of what you see  and wonder about what makes the universe exist Be curious Be miserable Or motivate yourself Whatever has to be done  its always your choice Consult not your fears but your hopes and your dreams Think not about your frustrations  but about your unfulfilled potential Concern yourself not with what you tried and failed in  but with what it is still possible for you to do By failing to prepare  you are preparing to fail Start by doing whats necessary  then do whats possible  and suddenly you are doing the impossible The best and most beautiful things in the world cannot be seen or even touched   they must be felt with the heart I cant change the direction of the wind  but I can adjust my sails to always reach my destination The best preparation for tomorrow is doing your best today We know what we are  but know not what we may be Keep your face always toward the sunshine   and shadows will fall behind you It is during our darkest moments that we must focus to see the light What lies behind you and what lies in front of you  pales in comparison to what lies inside of you No act of kindness  no matter how small  is ever wasted Even if I knew that tomorrow the world would go to pieces  I would still plant my apple tree Dont judge each day by the harvest you reap but by the seeds that you plant I hated every minute of training  but I said  Dont quit Suffer now and live the rest of your life as a champion Perfection is not attainable  but if we chase perfection we can catch excellence Ah  but a mans reach should exceed his grasp  Or whats a heaven for Clouds come floating into my life  no longer to carry rain or usher storm  but to add color to my sunset sky If you believe in yourself and have dedication and pride   and never quit  youll be a winner The price of victory is high but so are the rewards If opportunity doesnt knock  build a door If I have seen further than others  it is by standing upon the shoulders of giants We must let go of the life we have planned  so as to accept the one that is waiting for us There are two ways of spreading light  to be the candle or the mirror that reflects it Change your thoughts and you change your world The only journey is the one within It is never too late to be what you might have been Your present circumstances dont determine where you can go  they merely determine where you start The most authentic thing about us is our capacity to create  to overcome  to endure  to transform  to love and to be greater than our suffering Put your heart  mind  and soul into even your smallest acts This is the secret of success Happiness resides not in possessions  and not in gold  happiness dwells in the soul I am not afraid of tomorrow  for I have seen yesterday and I love today  No matter what people tell you  words and ideas can change the world Happiness is a butterfly  which when pursued  is always just beyond your grasp  but which  if you will sit down quietly  may alight upon you Out of difficulties grow miracles If a man does not keep pace with his companions  perhaps it is because he hears a different drummer Let him step to the music which he hears  however measured or far away Give light and people will find the way Today I choose life Every morning when I wake up I can choose joy  happiness  negativity  pain To feel the freedom that comes from being able to continue to make mistakes and choices   today I choose to feel life  not to deny my humanity but embrace it Just dont give up trying to do what you really want to do Where there is love and inspiration  I dont think you can go wrong My mission in life is not merely to survive  but to thrive  and to do so with some passion  some compassion  some humor  and some style Let us remember  One book  one pen  one child  and one teacher can change the world Somewhere  something incredible is waiting to be known A champion is someone who gets up when he cant I believe every human has a finite number of heartbeats I dont intend to waste any of mine Try to be a rainbow in someones cloud When you get into a tight place and everything goes against you  till it seems as though you could not hang on a minute longer  never give up then  for that is just the place and time that the tide will turn The undertaking of a new action brings new strength Light tomorrow with today  Every story I create  creates me I write to create myself When you have a dream  youve got to grab it and never let go Courage  my friends  tis not too late to build a better world Keep your feet on the ground  but let your heart soar as high as it will Refuse to be average or to surrender to the chill of your spiritual environment Someone is sitting in the shade today because someone planted a tree a long time ago Do your little bit of good where you are  its those little bits of good put together that overwhelm the world If there were no night  we would not appreciate the day  nor could we see the stars and the vastness of the heavens We must partake of the bitter with the sweet There is a divine purpose in the adversities we encounter every day They prepare  they purge  they purify  and thus they bless Learning how to be still  to really be still and let life happen   that stillness becomes a radiance It is always the simple that produces the marvelous The most beautiful thing in the world is  of course  the world itself The measure of who we are is what we do with what we have Nothing is impossible  the word itself says Im possible  If the world seems cold to you  kindle fires to warm it Two roads diverged in a wood and I   I took the one less traveled by  and that has made all the difference In oneself lies the whole world and if you know how to look and learn  the door is there and the key is in your hand Nobody on earth can give you either the key or the door to open  except yourself Let us make our future now  and let us make our dreams tomorrows reality Once you replace negative thoughts with positive ones  youll start having positive results The most important thing is to try and inspire people so that they can be great in whatever they want to do Yesterday is not ours to recover  but tomorrow is ours to win or lose Live life to the fullest  and focus on the positive A strong  positive self image is the best possible preparation for success Always turn a negative situation into a positive situation Few things in the world are more powerful than a positive push A smile A world of optimism and hope A you can do it when things are tough Your smile will give you a positive countenance that will make people feel comfortable around you If youre not making mistakes  then youre not doing anything Im positive that a doer makes mistakes The person who can bring the spirit of laughter into a room is indeed blessed Every day brings new choices Its a wonderful thing to be optimistic It keeps you healthy and it keeps you resilient Work hard  stay positive  and get up early Its the best part of the day A good laugh is sunshine in the house No matter what youre going through  theres a light at the end of the tunnel and it may seem hard to get to it but you can do it and just keep working towards it and youll find the positive side of things To succeed  you need to find something to hold on to  something to motivate you  something to inspire you I think anything is possible if you have the mindset and the will and desire to do it and put the time in Work hard for what you want because it wont come to you without a fight You have to be strong and courageous and know that you can do anything you put your mind to If somebody puts you down or criticizes you  just keep on believing in yourself and turn it into something positive I often think that the night is more alive and more richly colored than the day Correction does much  but encouragement does more Did I offer peace today Did I bring a smile to someones face Did I say words of healing Did I let go of my anger and resentment Did I forgive Did I love These are the real questions I must trust that the little bit of love that I sow now will bear many fruits  here in this world and the life to come I truly believe that everything that we do and everyone that we meet is put in our path for a purpose There are no accidents  were all teachers   if were willing to pay attention to the lessons we learn  trust our positive instincts and not be afraid to take risks or wait for some miracle to come knocking at our door Always Do Your Best Your best is going to change from moment to moment  it will be different when you are healthy as opposed to sick Under any circumstance  simply do your best  and you will avoid self judgment  self abuse and regret Positive thinking will let you do everything better than negative thinking will The joy of life comes from our encounters with new experiences  and hence there is no greater joy than to have an endlessly changing horizon  for each day to have a new and different sun I believe in karma  and I believe if you put out positive vibes to everybody  thats all youre going to get back Today or any day that phone may ring and bring good news Positive feelings come from being honest about yourself and accepting your personality  and physical characteristics  warts and all  and  from belonging to a family that accepts you without question If you have a positive attitude and constantly strive to give your best effort  eventually you will overcome your immediate problems and find you are ready for greater challenges You cannot have a positive life and a negative mind Delete the negative  accentuate the positive  When you wake up every day  you have two choices You can either be positive or negative  an optimist or a pessimist I choose to be an optimist Its all a matter of perspective Your attitude is like a box of crayons that color your world Constantly color your picture gray  and your picture will always be bleak Try adding some bright colors to the picture by including humor  and your picture begins to lighten up I believe if you keep your faith  you keep your trust  you keep the right attitude  if youre grateful  youll see God open up new doors Im looking forward to influencing others in a positive way My message is you can do anything if you just put your mind to it Positive anything is better than negative nothing I think a lot of times we dont pay enough attention to people with a positive attitude because we assume they are naive or stupid or unschooled In order to carry a positive action we must develop here a positive vision People deal too much with the negative  with what is wrong Why not try and see positive things  to just touch those things and make them bloom I surround myself with positive  productive people of good will and decency Say and do something positive that will help the situation  it doesnt take any brains to complain My purpose  to lift your spirit and to motivate you My dear friend  clear your mind of cant When you are enthusiastic about what you do  you feel this positive energy Its very simple Trust in dreams  for in them is hidden the gate to eternity You are the sum total of everything youve ever seen  heard  eaten  smelled  been told  forgot   its all there Everything influences each of us  and because of that I try to make sure that my experiences are positive My optimism wears heavy boots and is loud Its your outlook on life that counts If you take yourself lightly and dont take yourself too seriously  pretty soon you can find the humor in our everyday lives And sometimes it can be a lifesaver A positive attitude is something everyone can work on  and everyone can learn how to employ it I do believe were all connected I do believe in positive energy I do believe in the power of prayer I do believe in putting good out into the world And I believe in taking care of each other I believe in Karma If the good is sown  the good is collected When positive things are made  that returns well You learn far more from negative leadership than from positive leadership Because you learn how not to do it And  therefore  you learn how to do it Youre going to go through tough times   thats life But I say  Nothing happens to you  it happens for you See the positive in negative events I like to encourage people to realize that any action is a good action if its proactive and there is positive intent behind it I was determined to share my positive approach and not let diabetes stand in the way of enjoying my life The best thing to do when you find yourself in a hurting or vulnerable place is to surround yourself with the strongest  finest  most positive people you know Thats my gift I let that negativity roll off me like water off a ducks back If its not positive  I didnt hear it If you can overcome that  fights are easy But I have found that in the simple act of living with hope  and in the daily effort to have a positive impact in the world  the days I do have are made all the more meaningful and precious And for that I am grateful Keep your face to the sunshine and you cannot see a shadow It takes but one positive thought when given a chance to survive and thrive to overpower an entire army of negative thoughts Do not dwell in the past  do not dream of the future  concentrate the mind on the present moment Nothing in life is to be feared  it is only to be understood Now is the time to understand more  so that we may fear less He who has a why to live can bear almost any how We do not remember days  we remember moments Sometimes life hits you in the head with a brick Dont lose faith The truth is you dont know what is going to happen tomorrow Life is a crazy ride  and nothing is guaranteed Never be bullied into silence Never allow yourself to be made a victim Accept no ones definition of your life  define yourself We must be willing to let go of the life we have planned  so as to have the life that is waiting for us Life is what happens while you are busy making other plans Every man dies Not every man really lives Life is a dream for the wise  a game for the fool  a comedy for the rich  a tragedy for the poor Open your eyes  look within Are you satisfied with the life youre living We are here to add what we can to life  not to get what we can from life When I stand before God at the end of my life  I would hope that I would not have a single bit of talent left  and could say  I used everything you gave me Life is a song   sing it Life is a game   play it Life is a challenge   meet it Life is a dream   realize it Life is a sacrifice   offer it Life is love   enjoy it I went to the woods because I wished to live deliberately  to front only the essential facts of life  and see if I could not learn what it had to teach  and not  when I came to die  discover that I had not lived The purpose of life is a life of purpose Ships that pass in the night  and speak each other in passing  only a signal shown  and a distant voice in the darkness  So on the ocean of life  we pass and speak one another  only a look and a voice  then darkness again and a silence A man who dares to waste one hour of time has not discovered the value of life I have found that if you love life  life will love you back Youre only here for a short visit Dont hurry  dont worry And be sure to smell the flowers along the way Growth is the only evidence of life How far you go in life depends on your being tender with the young  compassionate with the aged  sympathetic with the striving and tolerant of the weak and strong Because someday in your life you will have been all of these A life is not important except in the impact it has on other lives The only disability in life is a bad attitude Dont go through life  grow through life Its all about quality of life and finding a happy balance between work and friends and family Life is 10 percent what you make it  and 90 percent how you take it Life is a mirror and will reflect back to the thinker what he thinks into it Life is what we make it  always has been  always will be We live in a rainbow of chaos Life is short and we have never too much time for gladdening the hearts of those who are travelling the dark journey with us Oh be swift to love  make haste to be kind You will never be happy if you continue to search for what happiness consists of You will never live if you are looking for the meaning of life Nobody made a greater mistake than he who did nothing because he could do only a little If you live long enough  youll make mistakes But if you learn from them  youll be a better person Its how you handle adversity  not how it affects you The main thing is never quit  never quit  never quit The art of life is to know how to enjoy a little and to endure very much All the art of living lies in a fine mingling of letting go and holding on Life is ten percent what happens to you and ninety percent how you respond to it Life isnt about finding yourself Life is about creating yourself Life is a lively process of becoming Surprise is the greatest gift which life can grant us Life is not a problem to be solved  but a reality to be experienced Life is a series of collisions with the future  it is not the sum of what we have been  but what we yearn to be I slept and dreamt that life was joy I awoke and saw that life was service I acted and behold  service was joy Good friends  good books and a sleepy conscience  this is the ideal life We cant plan life All we can do is be available for it You have enemies Good That means youve stood up for something  sometime in your life What do we live for  if not to make life less difficult for each other Life is a lot like jazz its best when you improvise Life is never easy for those who dream Our prime purpose in this life is to help others And if you cant help them  at least dont hurt them Life is a succession of moments  to live each one is to succeed Very little is needed to make a happy life  it is all within yourself  in your way of thinking Make space in your life for the things that matter  for family and friends  love and generosity  fun and joy Without this  you will burn out in mid career and wonder where your life went A life spent making mistakes is not only more honorable  but more useful than a life spent doing nothing What a wonderful life Ive had  I only wish Id realized it sooner Life is a series of natural and spontaneous changes Dont resist them   that only creates sorrow Let reality be reality Let things flow naturally forward in whatever way they like Life is made up of sobs  sniffles  and smiles  with sniffles predominating Life isnt a matter of milestones  but of moments To live is to change  and to be perfect is to have changed often Tis better to have loved and lost than never to have loved at all Were born alone  we live alone  we die alone Only through our love and friendship can we create the illusion for the moment that were not alone Let us always meet each other with smile  for the smile is the beginning of love Immature love says  I love you because I need you Mature love says I need you because I love you Love is always bestowed as a gift   freely  willingly and without expectation We dont love to be loved  we love to love To love oneself is the beginning of a lifelong romance Love isnt something you find Love is something that finds you Love has no age  no limit  and no death Love cures people   both the ones who give it and the ones who receive it Life is the flower for which love is the honey Time is too slow for those who wait  too swift for those who fear  too long for those who grieve  too short for those who rejoice  but for those who love  time is eternity The most powerful weapon on earth is the human soul on fire True love is like ghosts  which everyone talks about and few have seen True love cannot be found where it does not exist  nor can it be denied where it does Love doesnt make the world go round Love is what makes the ride worthwhile A flower cannot blossom without sunshine  and man cannot live without love Love is an act of endless forgiveness  a tender look which becomes a habit Love is like an hourglass  with the heart filling up as the brain empties To love and be loved is to feel the sun from both sides We need 4 hugs a day for survival We need 8 hugs a day for maintenance We need 12 hugs a day for growth Love is not only something you feel  it is something you do Love is  above all  the gift of oneself A kiss is a lovely trick designed by nature to stop speech when words become superfluous Love means to commit yourself without guarantee Love and compassion are necessities  not luxuries Without them humanity cannot survive The first duty of love is to listen Looking back  I have this to regret  that too often when I loved  I did not say so The inner reality of love can be recognized only by love Life without love is like a tree without blossoms or fruit Kindness in words creates confidence Kindness in thinking creates profoundness Kindness in giving creates love The greatest happiness of life is the conviction that we are loved  loved for ourselves  or rather  loved in spite of ourselves Love can sometimes be magic But magic can sometimes just be an illusion Love is a game that two can play and both win Only divine love bestows the keys of knowledge To love is to admire with the heart  to admire is to love with the mind Fortune and love favor the brave We waste time looking for the perfect lover  instead of creating the perfect love Love knows not distance  it hath no continent  its eyes are for the stars Love is the hardest habit to break  and the most difficult to satisfy Someday  after mastering the winds  the waves  the tides and gravity  we shall harness for God the energies of love  and then  for a second time in the history of the world  man will have discovered fire Love feels no burden  thinks nothing of trouble  attempts what is above its strength  pleads no excuse of impossibility  for it thinks all things lawful for itself  and all things possible Oh  love will make a dog howl in rhyme True love comes quietly  without banners or flashing lights If you hear bells  get your ears checked Dont threaten me with love  baby Lets just go walking in the rain All my life  my heart has yearned for a thing I cannot name There is no disguise which can hide love for long where it exists  or simulate it where it does not Theres no bad consequence to loving fully  with all your heart You always gain by giving love Spread love everywhere you go Let no one ever come to you without leaving happier Self love is the source of all our other loves Nobody has ever measured  not even poets  how much the heart can hold I have decided to stick with love Hate is too great a burden to bear A new command I give you  Love one another As I have loved you  so you must love one another Where there is love there is life Once the realization is accepted that even between the closest human beings infinite distances continue  a wonderful living side by side can grow  if they succeed in loving the distance between them which makes it possible for each to see the other whole against the sky Love yourself first and everything else falls into line You really have to love yourself to get anything done in this world The sweetest of all sounds is that of the voice of the woman we love Love is the ultimate expression of the will to live Love is a canvas furnished by nature and embroidered by imagination If you can learn to love yourself and all the flaws  you can love other people so much better And that makes you so happy Come live in my heart  and pay no rent A real friend is one who walks in when the rest of the world walks out The greatest gift of life is friendship  and I have received it One loyal friend is worth ten thousand relatives Friends are the siblings God never gave us A true friend is someone who is there for you when hed rather be anywhere else Things are never quite as scary when youve got a best friend Its the friends you can call up at 4 am that matter It takes a long time to grow an old friend Lovers have a right to betray you friends dont The friend in my adversity I shall always cherish most I can better trust those who helped to relieve the gloom of my dark hours than those who are so ready to enjoy with me the sunshine of my prosperity One of the most beautiful qualities of true friendship is to understand and to be understood The best time to make friends is before you need them She is a friend of mind She gather me  man The pieces I am  she gather them and give them back to me in all the right order Its good  you know  when you got a woman who is a friend of your mind Lay this unto your breast  Old friends  like old swords  still are trusted best There are no strangers here  Only friends you havent yet met There is nothing on this earth more to be prized than true friendship Let us be grateful to people who make us happy  they are the charming gardeners who make our souls blossom No person is your friend who demands your silence  or denies your right to grow I cannot even imagine where I would be today were it not for that handful of friends who have given me a heart full of joy Lets face it  friends make life a lot more fun Friendship improves happiness and abates misery  by the doubling of our joy and the dividing of our grief True friendship is like sound health  the value of it is seldom known until it is lost Friends show their love in times of trouble  not in happiness The only way to have a friend is to be one Sometimes being a friend means mastering the art of timing There is a time for silence A time to let go and allow people to hurl themselves into their own destiny And a time to prepare to pick up the pieces when its all over True friendship multiplies the good in life and divides its evils Strive to have friends  for life without friends is like life on a desert island to find one real friend in a lifetime is good fortune  to keep him is a blessing The world is round so that friendship may encircle it Yesm  old friends is always best  less you can catch a new one thats fit to make an old one out of Since there is nothing so well worth having as friends  never lose a chance to make them A mans friendships are one of the best measures of his worth Friendship is one mind in two bodies A true friend is one who overlooks your failures and tolerates your success  In the sweetness of friendship let there be laughter  and sharing of pleasures For in the dew of little things the heart finds its morning and is refreshed Friendship multiplies the good of life and divides the evil Rare as is true love  true friendship is rarer When we honestly ask ourselves which person in our lives means the most to us  we often find that it is those who  instead of giving advice  solutions  or cures  have chosen rather to share our pain and touch our wounds with a warm and tender hand In everyones life  at some time  our inner fire goes out It is then burst into flame by an encounter with another human being We should all be thankful for those people who rekindle the inner spirit Each friend represents a world in us  a world not born until they arrive  and it is only by this meeting that a new world is born I never considered a difference of opinion in politics  in religion  in philosophy  as cause for withdrawing from a friend I have learned that to be with those I like is enough If you have one true friend you have more than your share I dont need a friend who changes when I change and who nods when I nod  my shadow does that much better Without wearing any mask we are conscious of  we have a special face for each friend Friendship marks a life even more deeply than love Love risks degenerating into obsession  friendship is never anything but sharing You can always tell a real friend  when youve made a fool of yourself he doesnt feel youve done a permanent job There is a magnet in your heart that will attract true friends That magnet is unselfishness  thinking of others first  when you learn to live for others  they will live for you The bird a nest  the spider a web  man friendship Friends are born  not made The friend who can be silent with us in a moment of despair or confusion  who can stay with us in an hour of grief and bereavement  who can tolerate not knowing not healing  not curing that is a friend who cares Sweet is the memory of distant friends  Like the mellow rays of the departing sun  it falls tenderly  yet sadly  on the heart It is one of the blessings of old friends that you can afford to be stupid with them The real test of friendship is  can you literally do nothing with the other person Can you enjoy those moments of life that are utterly simple When you choose your friends  dont be short changed by choosing personality over character Friends and good manners will carry you where money wont go A friend to all is a friend to none Never explain   your friends do not need it and your enemies will not believe you anyway A friend is one who knows you and loves you just the same A single rose can be my garden a single friend  my world All you need to do to be my friend is like me Lots of people want to ride with you in the limo  but what you want is someone who will take the bus with you when the limo breaks down Some people go to priests  others to poetry  I to my friends Ability is what youre capable of doing Motivation determines what you do Attitude determines how well you do it Your attitude  not your aptitude  will determine your altitude Excellence is not a skill  its an attitude It is our attitude at the beginning of a difficult task which  more than anything else  will affect its successful outcome The attitude is very important Because  your behavior radiates how you feel A positive attitude can really make dreams come true   it did for me You cannot control what happens to you  but you can control your attitude toward what happens to you  and in that  you will be mastering change rather than allowing it to master you Our attitude toward life determines lifes attitude towards us Time plays a role in almost every decision And some decisions define your attitude about time Your living is determined not so much by what life brings to you as by the attitude you bring to life  not so much by what happens to you as by the way your mind looks at what happens My attitude is  if someones going to criticize me  tell me to my face The secret of genius is to carry the spirit of the child into old age  which means never losing your enthusiasm It is in the character of very few men to honor without envy a friend who has prospered People may hear your words  but they feel your attitude If your ego starts out  I am important  I am big  I am special  youre in for some disappointments when you look around at what weve discovered about the universe No  youre not big No  youre not Youre small in time and in space And you have this frail vessel called the human body thats limited on Earth If you are going to achieve excellence in big things  you develop the habit in little matters Excellence is not an exception  it is a prevailing attitude Wearing the correct dress for any occasion is a matter of good manners Some people say I have attitude   maybe I do but I think you have to You have to believe in yourself when no one else does   that makes you a winner right there Between stimulus and response  there is a space where we choose our response Acting is magical Change your look and your attitude  and you can be anyone Attitude determines the altitude of life Nothing can stop the man with the right mental attitude from achieving his goal  nothing on earth can help the man with the wrong mental attitude The greatest day in your life and mine is when we take total responsibility for our attitudes Thats the day we truly grow up Attitude is a little thing that makes a big difference Our future cannot depend on the government alone The ultimate solutions lie in the attitudes and the actions of the American people The greatest discovery of my generation is that a human being can alter his life by altering his attitudes For success  attitude is equally as important as ability Attitude is everything Our attitude towards others determines their attitude towards us When you aint got no money  you gotta get an attitude Pink isnt just a color  its an attitude  We cannot change our past We can not change the fact that people act in a certain way We can not change the inevitable The only thing we can do is play on the one string we have  and that is our attitude I think its my adventure  my trip  my journey  and I guess my attitude is  let the chips fall where they may Choosing to be positive and having a grateful attitude is going to determine how youre going to live your life A positive attitude causes a chain reaction of positive thoughts  events and outcomes It is a catalyst and it sparks extraordinary results Cock your hat   angles are attitudes It is not the bodys posture  but the hearts attitude that counts when we pray Happiness is an attitude of mind  born of the simple determination to be happy under all outward circumstances Having a positive mental attitude is asking how something can be done rather than saying it cant be done Everything can be taken from a man but one thing  the last of human freedoms   to choose ones attitude in any given set of circumstances  to choose ones own way Keep a good attitude and do the right thing even when its hard When you do that you are passing the test And God promises you your marked moments are on their way The ideal attitude is to be physically loose and mentally tight Reject your sense of injury and the injury itself disappears Character is the result of two things  mental attitude and the way we spend our time You cannot tailor make the situations in life but you can tailor make the attitudes to fit those situations You live in the image you have of the world Every one of us lives in a different world  with different space and different time Develop an attitude of gratitude  and give thanks for everything that happens to you  knowing that every step forward is a step toward achieving something bigger and better than your current situation But the attitude of faith is to let go  and become open to truth  whatever it might turn out to be Our lives are not determined by what happens to us but how we react to what happens  not by what life brings us but the attitude we bring to life Attitudes are more important than facts Whenever youre in conflict with someone  there is one factor that can make the difference between damaging your relationship and deepening it That factor is attitude The remarkable thing is  we have a choice everyday regarding the attitude we will embrace for that day Great effort springs naturally from great attitude There are no menial jobs  only menial attitudes Weakness of attitude becomes weakness of character Bad attitudes will ruin your team The meaning of things lies not in the things themselves  but in our attitude towards them Morality is simply the attitude we adopt towards people whom we personally dislike There is little difference in people  but that little difference makes a big difference The little difference is attitude The big difference is whether it is positive or negative Our environment  the world in which we live and work  is a mirror of our attitudes and expectations I refuse to join any club that would have me as a member Do not take life too seriously You will never get out of it alive I am not a member of any organized political party I am a Democrat Behind every great man is a woman rolling her eyes Age is something that doesnt matter  unless you are a cheese A day without sunshine is like  you know  night Whats another word for Thesaurus Only the mediocre are always at their best I always wanted to be somebody  but now I realize I should have been more specific Progress is mans ability to complicate simplicity My grandmother started walking five miles a day when she was sixty Shes ninety seven now  and we dont know where the hell she is If I had to live my life again  Id make the same mistakes  only sooner I am a marvelous housekeeper Every time I leave a man I keep his house Laugh and the world laughs with you  snore and you sleep alone Youre only as good as your last haircut All right everyone  line up alphabetically according to your height I love mankind  its people I cant stand Its amazing that the amount of news that happens in the world every day always just exactly fits the newspaper I believe that if life gives you lemons  you should make lemonade And try to find somebody whose life has given them vodka  and have a party By all means lets be open minded  but not so open minded that our brains drop out Tragedy is when I cut my finger Comedy is when you fall into an open sewer and die If you dont mind  it doesnt matter My life needs editing We are all here on earth to help others  what on earth the others are here for I dont know As a child my familys menu consisted of two choices  take it or leave it Any girl can be glamorous All you have to do is stand still and look stupid Smoking kills If youre killed  youve lost a very important part of your life My definition of an intellectual is someone who can listen to the William Tell Overture without thinking of the Lone Ranger I love deadlines I like the whooshing sound they make as they fly by Always remember that you are absolutely unique Just like everyone else There cannot be a crisis next week My schedule is already full Everything I like is either illegal  immoral or fattening I cook with wine  sometimes I even add it to the food Expert  a man who makes three correct guesses consecutively It takes considerable knowledge just to realize the extent of your own ignorance If you want a guarantee  buy a toaster Happiness is having a large  loving  caring  close knit family in another city Cleanliness becomes more important when godliness is unlikely Never put a sock in a toaster They say marriages are made in Heaven But so is thunder and lightning My theory is that all of Scottish cuisine is based on a dare No man has a good enough memory to be a successful liar Between two evils  I always pick the one I never tried before Every time I see an adult on a bicycle  I no longer despair for the future of the human race Procrastination is the art of keeping up with yesterday I can resist everything except temptation He looked about as inconspicuous as a tarantula on a slice of angel food There are only three things women need in life  food  water  and compliments If women ran the world we wouldnt have wars  just intense negotiations every 28 days People who think they know everything are a great annoyance to those of us who do A government that robs Peter to pay Paul can always depend on the support of Paul Life is hard After all  it kills you The trouble with having an open mind  of course  is that people will insist on coming along and trying to put things in it A successful man is one who makes more money than his wife can spend A successful woman is one who can find such a man I have tried to know absolutely nothing about a great many things  and I have succeeded fairly well Nobody ever went broke underestimating the taste of the American public Get your facts first  then you can distort them as you please Roses are red  violets are blue  Im schizophrenic  and so am I I knew I was an unwanted baby when I saw that my bath toys were a toaster and a radio I may be drunk  Miss  but in the morning I will be sober and you will still be ugly I went to the woods because I wished to live deliberately  to front only the essential facts of life  and see if I could not learn what it had to teach  and not  when I came to die  discover that I had not lived If a man does not keep pace with his companions  perhaps it is because he hears a different drummer Let him step to the music which he hears  however measured or far away What lies behind us and what lies ahead of us are tiny matters compared to what lives within us Rather than love  than money  than fame  give me truth Its not what you look at that matters  its what you see Success usually comes to those who are too busy to be looking for it Many men go fishing all of their lives without knowing that it is not fish they are after If one advances confidently in the direction of his dreams  and endeavors to live the life which he has imagined  he will meet with a success unexpected in common hours An early morning walk is a blessing for the whole day This world is but a canvas to our imagination The price of anything is the amount of life you exchange for it There are a thousand hacking at the branches of evil to one who is striking at the root Things do not change  we change Never look back unless you are planning to go that way Could a greater miracle take place than for us to look through each others eyes for an instant Heaven is under our feet as well as over our heads Not until we are lost do we begin to understand ourselves I know of no more encouraging fact than the unquestionable ability of man to elevate his life by conscious endeavor Disobedience is the true foundation of liberty The obedient must be slaves If you have built castles in the air  your work need not be lost  that is where they should be Now put the foundations under them Be not simply good   be good for something I would rather sit on a pumpkin and have it all to myself  than be crowded on a velvet cushion Our truest life is when we are in dreams awake Our life is frittered away by detail simplify  simplify There is no remedy for love but to love more I say  beware of all enterprises that require new clothes  and not rather a new wearer of clothes Make the most of your regrets  never smother your sorrow  but tend and cherish it till it comes to have a separate and integral interest To regret deeply is to live afresh Nature will bear the closest inspection She invites us to lay our eye level with her smallest leaf  and take an insect view of its plain Goodness is the only investment that never fails It is not enough to be busy So are the ants The question is  What are we busy about Wealth is the ability to fully experience life If the machine of government is of such a nature that it requires you to be the agent of injustice to another  then  I say  break the law As if you could kill time without injuring eternity Any fool can make a rule  and any fool will mind it Not only must we be good  but we must also be good for something Pursue some path  however narrow and crooked  in which you can walk with love and reverence Aim above morality Be not simply good  be good for something The language of friendship is not words but meanings A man is rich in proportion to the number of things he can afford to let alone If I knew for a certainty that a man was coming to my house with the conscious design of doing me good  I should run for my life The light which puts out our eyes is darkness to us Only that day dawns to which we are awake There is more day to dawn The sun is but a morning star It takes two to speak the truth  one to speak  and another to hear The most I can do for my friend is simply be his friend I am grateful for what I am and have My thanksgiving is perpetual Live your beliefs and you can turn the world around The mass of men lead lives of quiet desperation What is called resignation is confirmed desperation Friends they cherish one anothers hopes They are kind to one anothers dreams Live the life youve dreamed There is no value in life except what you choose to place upon it and no happiness in any place except what you bring to it yourself None are so old as those who have outlived enthusiasm Thank God men cannot fly  and lay waste the sky as well as the earth Nothing makes the earth seem so spacious as to have friends at a distance  they make the latitudes and longitudes You must live in the present  launch yourself on every wave  find your eternity in each moment It is better to have your head in the clouds  and know where you are than to breathe the clearer atmosphere below them  and think that you are in paradise Men have become the tools of their tools The bluebird carries the sky on his back Do not hire a man who does your work for money  but him who does it for love of it What is the use of a house if you havent got a tolerable planet to put it on I have always been regretting that I was not as wise as the day I was born Nature is full of genius  full of the divinity  so that not a snowflake escapes its fashioning hand The best and most beautiful things in the world cannot be seen or even touched   they must be felt with the heart We can do anything we want to if we stick to it long enough Optimism is the faith that leads to achievement Nothing can be done without hope and confidence Keep your face to the sunshine and you cannot see a shadow Alone we can do so little  together we can do so much Faith is the strength by which a shattered world shall emerge into the light Character cannot be developed in ease and quiet Only through experience of trial and suffering can the soul be strengthened  ambition inspired  and success achieved What we have once enjoyed we can never lose All that we love deeply becomes a part of us Walking with a friend in the dark is better than walking alone in the light The only thing worse than being blind is having sight but no vision Although the world is full of suffering  it is also full of the overcoming of it Everything has its wonders  even darkness and silence  and I learn  whatever state I may be in  therein to be content Security is mostly a superstition It does not exist in nature  nor do the children of men as a whole experience it Avoiding danger is no safer in the long run than outright exposure Life is either a daring adventure  or nothing Never bend your head Always hold it high Look the world straight in the eye Love is like a beautiful flower which I may not touch  but whose fragrance makes the garden a place of delight just the same We could never learn to be brave and patient  if there were only joy in the world The world is moved along  not only by the mighty shoves of its heroes  but also by the aggregate of tiny pushes of each honest worker The highest result of education is tolerance I long to accomplish a great and noble task  but it is my chief duty to accomplish small tasks as if they were great and noble True happiness is not attained through self gratification  but through fidelity to a worthy purpose Life is either a great adventure or nothing One can never consent to creep when one feels an impulse to soar So long as the memory of certain beloved friends lives in my heart  I shall say that life is good Avoiding danger is no safer in the long run than outright exposure The fearful are caught as often as the bold Your success and happiness lies in you Resolve to keep happy  and your joy and you shall form an invincible host against difficulties When we do the best that we can  we never know what miracle is wrought in our life  or in the life of another Knowledge is love and light and vision Death is no more than passing from one room into another But theres a difference for me  you know Because in that other room I shall be able to see Until the great mass of the people shall be filled with the sense of responsibility for each others welfare  social justice can never be attained To me a lush carpet of pine needles or spongy grass is more welcome than the most luxurious Persian rug No pessimist ever discovered the secret of the stars  or sailed to an uncharted land  or opened a new doorway for the human spirit While they were saying among themselves it cannot be done  it was done The marvelous richness of human experience would lose something of rewarding joy if there were no limitations to overcome The hilltop hour would not be half so wonderful if there were no dark valleys to traverse It is hard to interest those who have everything in those who have nothing Many persons have a wrong idea of what constitutes true happiness It is not attained through self gratification but through fidelity to a worthy purpose The most pathetic person in the world is someone who has sight  but has no vision What I am looking for is not out there  it is in me Once I knew only darkness and stillness my life was without past or future but a little word from the fingers of another fell into my hand that clutched at emptiness  and my heart leaped to the rapture of living Self pity is our worst enemy and if we yield to it  we can never do anything wise in this world I seldom think about my limitations  and they never make me sad Perhaps there is just a touch of yearning at times  but it is vague  like a breeze among flowers Science may have found a cure for most evils  but it has found no remedy for the worst of them all   the apathy of human beings I do not want the peace which passeth understanding  I want the understanding which bringeth peace Life is an exciting business  and most exciting when it is lived for others It is a terrible thing to see and have no vision Of all the senses  sight must be the most delightful Toleration is the greatest gift of the mind  it requires the same effort of the brain that it takes to balance oneself on a bicycle All the world is full of suffering It is also full of overcoming Its wonderful to climb the liquid mountains of the sky Behind me and before me is God and I have no fears It is wonderful how much time good people spend fighting the devil If they would only expend the same amount of energy loving their fellow men  the devil would die in his own tracks of ennui People do not like to think If one thinks  one must reach conclusions Conclusions are not always pleasant I can see  and that is why I can be happy  in what you call the dark  but which to me is golden I can see a God made world  not a manmade world Smell is a potent wizard that transports you across thousands of miles and all the years you have lived As the eagle was killed by the arrow winged with his own feather  so the hand of the world is wounded by its own skill Literature is my Utopia Here I am not disenfranchised No barrier of the senses shuts me out from the sweet  gracious discourses of my book friends They talk to me without embarrassment or awkwardness The heresy of one age becomes the orthodoxy of the next What a blind person needs is not a teacher but another self It is for us to pray not for tasks equal to our powers  but for powers equal to our tasks  to go forward with a great desire forever beating at the door of our hearts as we travel toward our distant goal College isnt the place to go for ideas There is no king who has not had a slave among his ancestors  and no slave who has not had a king among his As selfishness and complaint pervert the mind  so love with its joy clears and sharpens the vision It is easier to build strong children than to repair broken men Where justice is denied  where poverty is enforced  where ignorance prevails  and where any one class is made to feel that society is an organized conspiracy to oppress  rob and degrade them  neither persons nor property will be safe It is not light that we need  but fire  it is not the gentle shower  but thunder We need the storm  the whirlwind  and the earthquake I prayed for twenty years but received no answer until I prayed with my legs Power concedes nothing without a demand It never did and it never will Find out just what any people will quietly submit to and you have the exact measure of the injustice and wrong which will be imposed on them The limits of tyrants are prescribed by the endurance of those whom they oppress The life of the nation is secure only while the nation is honest  truthful  and virtuous No man can put a chain about the ankle of his fellow man without at last finding the other end fastened about his own neck I am a Republican  a black  dyed in the wool Republican  and I never intend to belong to any other party than the party of freedom and progress If there is no struggle  there is no progress To suppress free speech is a double wrong It violates the rights of the hearer as well as those of the speaker The thing worse than rebellion is the thing that causes rebellion One and God make a majority The soul that is within me no man can degrade I prefer to be true to myself  even at the hazard of incurring the ridicule of others  rather than to be false  and to incur my own abhorrence A mans character always takes its hue  more or less  from the form and color of things about him America is false to the past  false to the present  and solemnly binds herself to be false to the future People might not get all they work for in this world  but they must certainly work for all they get Those who profess to favor freedom  and yet depreciate agitation  are men who want crops without plowing up the ground We have to do with the past only as we can make it useful to the present and the future The white mans happiness cannot be purchased by the black mans misery I didnt know I was a slave until I found out I couldnt do the things I wanted A battle lost or won is easily described  understood  and appreciated  but the moral growth of a great nation requires reflection  as well as observation  to appreciate it When men sow the wind it is rational to expect that they will reap the whirlwind Mans greatness consists in his ability to do and the proper application of his powers to things needed to be done At a time like this  scorching irony  not convincing argument  is needed A gentleman will not insult me  and no man not a gentleman can insult me A little learning  indeed  may be a dangerous thing  but the want of learning is a calamity to any people Everybody has asked the question  and they learned to ask it early of the abolitionists  What shall we do with the Negro I have had but one answer from the beginning Do nothing with us  Your doing with us has already played the mischief with us What to the Slave is the 4th of July Those who profess to favor freedom  and yet deprecate agitation  are men who want crops without plowing up the ground I recognize the Republican party as the sheet anchor of the colored mans political hopes and the ark of his safety There is not a man beneath the canopy of Heaven who does not know that slavery is wrong for him That which is inhuman cannot be divine I could  as a free man  look across the bay toward the Eastern Shore where I was born a slave Slaves are generally expected to sing as well as to work Experience demonstrates that there may be a wages of slavery only a little less galling and crushing in its effects than chattel slavery  and that this slavery of wages must go down with the other Fugitive slaves were rare then  and as a fugitive slave lecturer  I had the advantage of being the first one out Great achievement is usually born of great sacrifice  and is never the result of selfishness Think twice before you speak  because your words and influence will plant the seed of either success or failure in the mind of another Every adversity  every failure  every heartache carries with it the seed of an equal or greater benefit Strength and growth come only through continuous effort and struggle If you cannot do great things  do small things in a great way Whatever the mind of man can conceive and believe  it can achieve The man who does more than he is paid for will soon be paid for more than he does The starting point of all achievement is desire It takes half your life before you discover life is a do it yourself project Cherish your visions and your dreams as they are the children of your soul  the blueprints of your ultimate achievements Patience  persistence and perspiration make an unbeatable combination for success Dont wait The time will never be just right A goal is a dream with a deadline If you do not conquer self  you will be conquered by self Opportunity often comes disguised in the form of misfortune  or temporary defeat Victory is always possible for the person who refuses to stop fighting It is literally true that you can succeed best and quickest by helping others to succeed Procrastination is the bad habit of putting off until the day after tomorrow what should have been done the day before yesterday Education comes from within  you get it by struggle and effort and thought Effort only fully releases its reward after a person refuses to quit Your big opportunity may be right where you are now The ladder of success is never crowded at the top Desire is the starting point of all achievement  not a hope  not a wish  but a keen pulsating desire which transcends everything There is one quality which one must possess to win  and that is definiteness of purpose  the knowledge of what one wants  and a burning desire to possess it Action is the real measure of intelligence What the mind of man can conceive and believe  it can achieve There is no such thing as Something for nothing More gold has been mined from the thoughts of men than has been taken from the earth Fears are nothing more than a state of mind Most great people have attained their greatest success just one step beyond their greatest failure Man  alone  has the power to transform his thoughts into physical reality  man  alone  can dream and make his dreams come true First comes thought  then organization of that thought  into ideas and plans  then transformation of those plans into reality The beginning  as you will observe  is in your imagination When defeat comes  accept it as a signal that your plans are not sound  rebuild those plans  and set sail once more toward your coveted goal Persistence is to the character of man as carbon is to steel The best way to sell yourself to others is first to sell the others to yourself Edison failed 10 000 times before he made the electric light Do not be discouraged if you fail a few times No man can succeed in a line of endeavor which he does not like Happiness is found in doing  not merely possessing Create a definite plan for carrying out your desire and begin at once  whether you ready or not  to put this plan into action No man is ever whipped until he quits in his own mind When your desires are strong enough you will appear to possess superhuman powers to achieve Wise men  when in doubt whether to speak or to keep quiet  give themselves the benefit of the doubt  and remain silent The majority of men meet with failure because of their lack of persistence in creating new plans to take the place of those which fail All achievements  all earned riches  have their beginning in an idea There are no limitations to the mind except those we acknowledge Big pay and little responsibility are circumstances seldom found together Before success comes in any mans life  hes sure to meet with much temporary defeat and  perhaps some failures When defeat overtakes a man  the easiest and the most logical thing to do is to quit Thats exactly what the majority of men do Nature cannot be tricked or cheated She will give up to you the object of your struggles only after you have paid her price Any idea  plan  or purpose may be placed in the mind through repetition of thought Money without brains is always dangerous You might well remember that nothing can bring you success but yourself The world has the habit of making room for the man whose actions show that he knows where he is going Just as our eyes need light in order to see  our minds need ideas in order to conceive Every person who wins in any undertaking must be willing to cut all sources of retreat Only by doing so can one be sure of maintaining that state of mind known as a burning desire to win   essential to success All the breaks you need in life wait within your imagination  Imagination is the workshop of your mind  capable of turning mind energy into accomplishment and wealth If you must speak ill of another  do not speak it  write it in the sand near the waters edge It is always your next move No man ever achieved worth while success who did not  at one time or other  find himself with at least one foot hanging well over the brink of failure Everyone enjoys doing the kind of work for which he is best suited You can start right where you stand and apply the habit of going the extra mile by rendering more service and better service than you are now being paid for Love is our true destiny We do not find the meaning of life by ourselves alone   we find it with another Pride makes us artificial and humility makes us real Art enables us to find ourselves and lose ourselves at the same time Happiness is not a matter of intensity but of balance  order  rhythm and harmony The beginning of love is to let those we love be perfectly themselves  and not to twist them to fit our own image Otherwise we love only the reflection of ourselves we find in them We are not at peace with others because we are not at peace with ourselves  and we are not at peace with ourselves because we are not at peace with God The whole idea of compassion is based on a keen awareness of the interdependence of all these living beings  which are all part of one another  and all involved in one another Peace demands the most heroic labor and the most difficult sacrifice It demands greater heroism than war It demands greater fidelity to the truth and a much more perfect purity of conscience When ambition ends  happiness begins Every moment and every event of every mans life on earth plants something in his soul The biggest human temptation is to settle for too little What can we gain by sailing to the moon if we are not able to cross the abyss that separates us from ourselves This is the most important of all voyages of discovery  and without it  all the rest are not only useless  but disastrous Perhaps I am stronger than I think Love seeks one thing only  the good of the one loved It leaves all the other secondary effects to take care of themselves Love  therefore  is its own reward We do not exist for ourselves alone  and it is only when we are fully convinced of this fact that we begin to love ourselves properly and thus also love others We have what we seek  it is there all the time  and if we give it time  it will make itself known to us If you want to study the social and political history of modern nations  study hell A life is either all spiritual or not spiritual at all No man can serve two masters Your life is shaped by the end you live for You are made in the image of what you desire We must make the choices that enable us to fulfill the deepest capacities of our real selves We are so obsessed with doing that we have no time and no imagination left for being As a result  men are valued not for what they are but for what they do or what they have   for their usefulness We stumble and fall constantly even when we are most enlightened But when we are in true spiritual darkness  we do not even know that we have fallen By reading the scriptures I am so renewed that all nature seems renewed around me and with me The sky seems to be a pure  a cooler blue  the trees a deeper green The whole world is charged with the glory of God and I feel fire and music under my feet Solitude is not something you must hope for in the future Rather  it is a deepening of the present  and unless you look for it in the present you will never find it The tighter you squeeze  the less you have Just remaining quietly in the presence of God  listening to Him  being attentive to Him  requires a lot of courage and know how To consider persons and events and situations only in the light of their effect upon myself is to live on the doorstep of hell Yet it is in this loneliness that the deepest activities begin It is here that you discover act without motion  labor that is profound repose  vision in obscurity  and  beyond all desire  a fulfillment whose limits extend to infinity A daydream is an evasion Be good  keep your feet dry  your eyes open  your heart at peace and your soul in the joy of Christ In the last analysis  the individual person is responsible for living his own life and for finding himself If he persists in shifting his responsibility to somebody else  he fails to find out the meaning of his own existence The very contradictions in my life are in some ways signs of Gods mercy to me October is a fine and dangerous season in America a wonderful time to begin anything at all You go to college  and every course in the catalogue looks wonderful Wheels of fire  cosmic  rich  full bodied honest victories over desperation Death is someone you see very clearly with eyes in the center of your heart  eyes that see not by reacting to light  but by reacting to a kind of a chill from within the marrow of your own life The first step toward finding God  Who is Truth  is to discover the truth about myself  and if I have been in error  this first step to truth is the discovery of my error I cannot make the universe obey me I cannot make other people conform to my own whims and fancies I cannot make even my own body obey me The least of the work of learning is done in the classroom On the last day of January 1915  in the second year of the Great War  down in the shadow of some French mountains on the borders of Spain  I came into this world Attachment to spiritual things is just as much an attachment as inordinate love of anything else Advertising treats all products with the reverence and the seriousness due to sacraments I brought all the instincts of a writer with me into the monastery The best preparation for tomorrow is doing your best today Never forget the three powerful resources you always have available to you  love  prayer  and forgiveness Live so that when your children think of fairness  caring  and integrity  they think of you Our character is what we do when we think no one is looking Love is when the other persons happiness is more important than your own Life doesnt require that we be the best  only that we try our best Remember that the happiest people are not those getting more  but those giving more Sometimes the heart sees what is invisible to the eye Nothing is more expensive than a missed opportunity Opportunity dances with those already on the dance floor Remember that the most valuable antiques are dear old friends Never give up on what you really want to do The person with big dreams is more powerful than the one with all the facts Earn your success based on service to others  not at the expense of others Talent without discipline is like an octopus on roller skates Theres plenty of movement  but you never know if its going to be forward  backwards  or sideways Always kiss your children goodnight  even if theyre already asleep Never deprive someone of hope  it might be all they have You must take action now that will move you towards your goals Develop a sense of urgency in your life Remember that children  marriages  and flower gardens reflect the kind of care they get Dont work for recognition  but do work worthy of recognition If youre doing your best  you wont have any time to worry about failure Think big thoughts but relish small pleasures Success is getting what you want Happiness is liking what you get A true friend encourages us  comforts us  supports us like a big easy chair  offering us a safe refuge from the world You either make dust or eat dust Let the refining and improving of your own life keep you so busy that you have little time to criticize others Choose your lifes mate carefully From this one decision will come 90 percent of all your happiness or misery Find a job you like and you add five days to every week People take different roads seeking fulfillment and happiness Just because theyre not on your road doesnt mean theyve gotten lost Enjoy the satisfaction that comes from doing little things well Hope is not a resting place but a starting point   a cactus  not a cushion Good manners sometimes means simply putting up with other peoples bad manners Always have something beautiful in sight  even if its just a daisy in a jelly glass Protect your enthusiasm from the negativity of others When facing a difficult task  act as though it is impossible to fail If you are going after Moby Dick  take along the tartar sauce Remember that a gesture of friendship  no matter how small  is always appreciated Be smarter than other people  just dont tell them so You cant hire someone to practice for you Remember that lifes big changes rarely give advance warning I never expect to lose Even when Im the underdog  I still prepare a victory speech If someone offers you a breath mint  accept it You can always tell when a mans well informed His views are pretty much like your own Luck marches with those who give their very best See any detour as an opportunity to experience new things Remember that creating a successful marriage is like farming  you have to start over again every morning Watch your finances like a hawk In business or in life  dont follow the wagon tracks too closely Measure your wealth by what youd have left if you lost all your money Marrying an old bachelor is like buying second hand furniture There is a fundamental question we all have to face How are we to live our lives  by what principles and moral values will we be guided and inspired Remember that no relationship is a total waste of time You can always learn something about yourself When you have nothing important or interesting to say  dont let anyone persuade you to say it Compliment three people every day Were constantly striving for success  fame and comfort when all we really need to be happy is someone or some thing to be enthusiastic about Mature love is composed and sustaining  a celebration of commitment  companionship  and trust Its true  once you are a father  theres no turning back Your heart strings as well as your purse strings are never again the same While we may lose heart  we never have to lose hope Living big and joyful and content is almost always the result of our finding satisfaction in lifes ordinary day to day pleasures And God must be fond of them  too  for He made so many of them for us to enjoy Hope is the magic carpet that transports us from the present moment into the realm of infinite possibilities Oh  the difference between nearly right and exactly right Hold puppies  kittens  and babies anytime you get the chance Ants are good citizens  they place group interests first Informations pretty thin stuff unless mixed with experience We must make the best of those ills which cannot be avoided If your parents didnt have any children  theres a good chance that you wont have any The ant is knowing and wise  but he doesnt know enough to take a vacation Age should not have its face lifted  but it should rather teach the world to admire wrinkles as the etchings of experience and the firm line of character There is an art of reading  as well as an art of thinking  and an art of writing Reason is the servant of instinct Too many moralists begin with a dislike of reality We talk of our mastery of nature  which sounds very grand  but the fact is we respectfully adapt ourselves  first  to her ways You cant sweep other people off their feet  if you cant be swept off your own If you dont go to other mens funerals  they wont go to yours A moderate addiction to money may not always be hurtful  but when taken in excess it is nearly always bad for the health Creatures whose mainspring is curiosity enjoy the accumulating of facts far more than the pausing at times to reflect on those facts We must let go of the life we have planned  so as to accept the one that is waiting for us A hero is someone who has given his or her life to something bigger than oneself Find a place inside where theres joy  and the joy will burn out the pain Follow your bliss and the universe will open doors where there were only walls Opportunities to find deeper powers within ourselves come when life seems most challenging The privilege of a lifetime is being who you are The goal of life is to make your heartbeat match the beat of the universe  to match your nature with Nature Life is without meaning You bring the meaning to it The meaning of life is whatever you ascribe it to be Being alive is the meaning Participate joyfully in the sorrows of the world We cannot cure the world of sorrows  but we can choose to live in joy I dont believe people are looking for the meaning of life as much as they are looking for the experience of being alive Your sacred space is where you can find yourself again and again Love is a friendship set to music It is by going down into the abyss that we recover the treasures of life Where you stumble  there lies your treasure Computers are like Old Testament gods  lots of rules and no mercy The big question is whether you are going to be able to say a hearty yes to your adventure Your life is the fruit of your own doing You have no one to blame but yourself God is a metaphor for that which transcends all levels of intellectual thought Its as simple as that Myths are public dreams  dreams are private myths What each must seek in his life never was on land or sea It is something out of his own unique potentiality for experience  something that never has been and never could have been experienced by anyone else When we quit thinking primarily about ourselves and our own self preservation  we undergo a truly heroic transformation of consciousness When people get married because they think its a long time love affair  theyll be divorced very soon  because all love affairs end in disappointment But marriage is a recognition of a spiritual identity Every religion is true one way or another It is true when understood metaphorically But when it gets stuck in its own metaphors  interpreting them as facts  then you are in trouble When you make the sacrifice in marriage  youre sacrificing not to each other but to unity in a relationship I dont have to have faith  I have experience One way or another  we all have to find what best fosters the flowering of our humanity in this contemporary life  and dedicate ourselves to that Were so engaged in doing things to achieve purposes of outer value that we forget the inner value  the rapture that is associated with being alive  is what it is all about I think the person who takes a job in order to live   that is to say  for the money   has turned himself into a slave Is the system going to flatten you out and deny you your humanity  or are you going to be able to make use of the system to the attainment of human purposes '"
